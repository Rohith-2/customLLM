B. Reason
Problem
Inspections of the Tail Bearing Housing (TBH) to Non-Modification Service
Bulletin (NMSB) 72-AG971 have identified crack indications in the mount Lug
forging Leading Edge (LE) area which require additional inspection criteria as
part of a revised containment strategy.
An on-wing and in-shop inspection regime has been defined for the mount Lug
forging LE areas to contain the issue and further inform root cause
understanding.
C. Description
This NMSB instructs the following:
On-wing or in-shop Non-Destructive Test (NDT) inspections of the mount lug
forging LE area which is required on all Trent 900 engines with TBH part
numbers FW27718, FW35923, FW51434 only, every 1000 flight cycles.
This NMSB details the on-wing and in-shop inspection techniques for the TBH.

ES OC BULLETIN
On-wing, the mount Lug forging LE area 1s to be Fluorescent Penetrant
Inspection (FPI) crack tested. In-shop, the mount lug forging LE area can
either be inspected using a Local FPI method or through a full FPI of the
entire TBH.
Results of the inspections are to be returned to Rolls-Royce. Return Appendix 1 =

Revision 1 of this NMSB was issued to revise the NOTE included in 3.A.(3).(t). >
to change the number of flight cycles from 5 to 10 and minor non-technical @
changes. =
w
Revision 2 of this NMSB was issued to include the Local polishing and etching =
repair alternative in the event of a crack indication finding during a local
FPI inspection. This 18 expected to remove a proportion of shallow cracks and
restore engine serviceability. This repair can only be accomplished once per
vane. It also clarifies that the inspection interval is Linked to the Life of
the TBH rather than the engine Life.
Revision 3 of this NMSB was issued to correct a typographical error to the AMM
task number referenced for on-wing Repair FRSH741 in step 3.A.(3)(t)
Accomplishment Instructions and 1.1. References.
R Revision 4 of this NMSB was issued to update the re-inspection intervals for
R the different crack sizes on-wing. It also eliminated the crack size Limitation
R for the application of the polishing and etching repair on-wing and provided an
R alternative Light source for the FPI inspection. This revision also Limited the
effectivity to engines with TBH part numbers FW27718, FW35923, FW51434 only.
R Revision 5 of this NMSB is issued to remove inspection of the TBH fail safe
R catcher. This was included during the initial root cause investigation and it
R has now been established that contact between the fail safe catcher and the
R engine mount system is not the cause of the cracking issue.
D. Compliance
ALERT
This NMSB is the subject of an EASA Airworthiness Directive AD 2013-0240.
Rolls-Royce recommends that the following action 1s undertaken to maintain
continued airworthiness.
This NMSB applies to both on-wing and in-shop activities.
(1) On-wing:
