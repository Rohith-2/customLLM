A. Compliance
This TV should be applied on all Engines where the Module 52 is Level 1 (Serviceability). The inspection
should be carried out whilst the part is at module level and strip of the module to piece part is not
required.
For Engines where the Module 52 is Level 2 (Check and Repair) the TV is not required as the TBH will
receive a full Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) in accordance with NMSB 72-AG971.
For all Engines currently in shop, this TV should be applied regardless of rebuild status.
For engines that are hospital shop visit, this TV can be applied.
For all Engines not currently installed on an Aircraft and not planned for induction into an overhaul shop,
this TV can be applied.
B. Manpower Requirements
1) In Shop
(a) Time to inspect Mount Lug Forging LE Areas
2 hours (2 persons)

The FPI defined in this Technical Instruction shall only be performed by personnel qualified to Fluorescent
Penetrant Inspection FPI Level 2 or higher and in possession of an up to date eyesight record in
accordance with EN4179/NAS410 or alternative standards/guidelines accepted by the applicable National
Aviation Authority.

1) Processing the penetrant test panel

(i) The OMat 677 — penetrant test panel must be processed at the beginning of
each shift and viewed in each engine that is to be inspected during the shift in
order to ensure that the test environment and materials are acceptable.

(ii) Ensure the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel is clean and there is no residual
fluorescence.

(iii) Cover the region of the engine to be inspected with a dark non-reflective cover in
order to reduce the white light levels in the leading edge inspection area.

(iv) Apply OMat 632 penetrant to the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel by sponge
applicator or brush. The penetrant must be dispensed from a sealed aerosol can
and any unused penetrant must go to waste following the inspection.

(v) Leave the penetrant in contact with the panel for 20 minutes.

(vi) After the 20 minutes contact time, take the OMat 677 penetrant test panel inside
the darkened area to process. Allow 3 minutes for eye adaptation to the low light
levels.

(vii) Remove the excess penetrant from the panel surface by wiping thoroughly with a
clean, dry OMat 2/101 — lint free cloth whilst illuminating the panel with UV light.

(vill) © Soak a clean OMat 2/10 - lint free cloth in water and then gently squeeze the
excess water out to reduce the flow of water on the panel surface.

(ix) Whilst illuminating the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel with UV light, wipe off the
penetrant with the wet cloth before immediately wiping over with a clean, dry
OMatz2/10 lint free cloth. Repeat this process using the minimum application
necessary to achieve acceptable background fluorescence.

(x) Ensure that the panel is dry by wiping with a clean, dry OMat2/10 lint free cloth.

(xi) Apply a light, even coating of OMat 617 — non-aqueous wet developer from a
sealed aerosol can to the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel.

(xii) Allow 10 minutes contact time for the developer prior to inspecting the panel.

(xiil) Ensure there are no white light sources or fluorescent items (including clothing)
within the darkened area.

(xiv) | Hold the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel alongside the leading edge of the Top
Core Vanes and illuminate it with UV light.

(xv) Inspect the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel and check that the visible
indications match the control photograph for that panel.

(xvi) If the panel matches the photograph then the inspection materials and
environment are acceptable and the inspections can be performed.

(xvil) Repeat steps (xiii) to (xvi) for each engine to be inspected during the shift.
Ensure that the inspection area is darkened for each engine.

(xvili) Restore the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel to a completely clean condition and
ensure there is no residual fluorescence and store in acetone.

2) Carry out the inspection of the Mount Lug Forging LE Area
WARNING: PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND SAFETY GLASSES MUST BE WORN AT ALL
TIMES DURING THE INSPECTION. IF YOU GET AN INJURY, SEEK MEDICAL
AID IMMEDIATELY.

(i) Clean the inspection areas (See Fig. 2) with a clean OMat 2/101 — lint free cloth
moistened with OMat 150 — acetone.

(ii) Discard the soiled cloth after use.

(iii) Repeat the swabbing using fresh OMat 150 — acetone and a fresh OMat 2/101 —
lint free cloth until all deposits have been removed.

NOTE: THE INSPECTION SURFACE, MUST BE CLEAN, DRY AND FREE FROM
SOILS, OIL, GREASE, PAINT, COATINGS, CORROSION PRODUCTS, SCALE,
SMEARED METAL, WELDING FLUX, CHEMICAL RESIDUES OR ANY OTHER
MATERIAL THAT COULD PREVENT PENETRANT FROM ENTERING A
DISCONTINUITY, AFFECT PROCESS PERFORMANCE OR PRODUCE AN
UNACCEPTABLE BACKGROUND.

(iv) Allow 5 minutes for the area to completely dry prior to penetrant application.

(v) Apply OMat 632 penetrant to the inspection areas in Fig.2. The penetrants must
be dispensed from a sealed aerosol can and any unused penetrant must go to
waste.

(vi) Ensure that the inspection areas are fully covered with penetrant with the aid of
the UV lamp and mirror.

(vii) Leave the penetrant in contact with the components for 20 minutes.

NOTE: THE PENETRANT CONTACT TIME MUST NOT EXCEED 1 HOUR. IF IT DOES
THE PENETRANT MUST BE REAPPLIED AND 5 MINUTES CONTACT TIME
ALLOWED.

(viii) | After the 20 minutes contact time, remove the excess penetrant from the
inspection surface by wiping thoroughly with a clean OMat 2/101 — lint free cloth.

(ix) Soak a clean OMat 2/10 - lint free cloth in water and then gently squeeze the
excess water out to reduce the flow of water on the component surface.

(x) Whilst illuminating the inspection area with UV light, wipe off the penetrant with
the wet cloth before immediately wiping over with a clean, dry OMatz2/10 lint free
cloth. Repeat this process using the minimum application necessary to achieve
acceptable background fluorescence.

(xi) Ensure that the inspection area is dry by wiping with a dry OMat2/10 lint free
cloth.

(xii) Apply a light, even coating of OMat 617 — non-aqueous wet developer from a
sealed aerosol can to the inspection area and the OMat 677 — penetrant test
panel.
