B. Concurrent Requirements
None.
C. Reason
(1) Problem and Evidence
Premature fatigue cracking, on a number of LP Turbine Exhaust Case and
Support Assemblies at vanes 1 and 14 leading edge fillets, have been
observed during in-service fluorescent penetrant inspections.
This is attributed to high thermal peak stress at initial ramps during the
flight cycle.
(2) Substantiation
The changes introduced by this Service Bulletin have been the subject of
satisfactory engineering evaluation, including stress and thermal
analysis.
(3) Objective
Incorporation of this Service Bulletin (Modification) is designed to
maintain reliability.

D. Description
(1) The changes are:
(a) Revised LP Turbine Exhaust Case and Support Assemblies are introduced
similar to the existing items except they are produced by reworking
existing assemblies by machining scallops at the Leading edge fillets
of vanes 1 and 14.
(2) This Service Bulletin is in three parts as follows:
(a) Part 1
Rework of LP turbine exhaust case and support assembly to Service
Bulletin 7?2-F250 standard.
(b) Part 2
Rework of LP turbine exhaust case and support assembly to Service
Bulletin 72-E439 standard.
(c) Part 3
Rework of LP turbine exhaust case and support assembly to pre-Service
Bulletin 7?2-F250 standard.
