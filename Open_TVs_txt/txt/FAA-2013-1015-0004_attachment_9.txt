TV Title Fiuorescent Penetrant Inspection of the Tail Bearing Housing, Mount Lug Run-outs.
Existing Requirement
The Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) and the Engine Manual (EM) do not contain a specific procedure
for Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) of the Mount Lug Run-outs. This Technical Variance details the
procedure for FPI of the TBH Mount Lug Run-outs.
Requested Variance
ISSUE 2 DUE TO CHANGE IN ENGINE SERIAL NUMBERS.
A Technical Variance is requested to detail the procedure for the TBH inspection for both on wing and in
shop inspections on the engines specified in Appendix 1 and 2.
The engines in Appendix 1 are to be inspected on wing. The engine in Appendix 2 is scheduled for induction
into SAESL on 17" July 2012 and as such the inspection is to be carried out in shop.
Summary of Investigation and Conclusions
Rolls-Royce Engineering have reviewed the above requirement and an on wing trial of the FPI of the TBH
Mount Lug Run-outs has been conducted.
This Technical Variance is issued to instruct the inspection of the TBH Mount Lug Run-outs for the engines
specified in Appendix 1 and 2 pending issue of a planned Non-modification Service Bulletin.

PROCEDURE —- ON WING
WARNING: YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU WORK ON THE ENGINE AFTER THE
ENGINE IS SHUTDOWN. THE ENGINE CAN STAY HOT FOR UPTO ONE
HOUR.
WARNING: YOU MUST NOT TOUCH HOT PARTS WITHOUT APPLICABLE GLOVES. HOT
PARTS CAN CAUSE INJURY. IF YOU GET AN INJURY, TREAT WITH COLD
WATER FOR 10 MINUTES, THEN SEEK MEDICAL AID.
1) To get access to the Tail Bearing Housing (TBH) Mount Lug Run-outs
|. Open the Fan Cowl Doors in accordance with AMM Task 71-13-00, Maintenance
Practices to get access
li. Make the Thrust Reverser unserviceable for maintenance in accordance with
AMM Task 78-30-00 Deactivation/Activation.
WARNING: YOU MUST MAKE THE THRUST REVERSER UNSERVICEABLE (INSTALL
AND SAFETY THE INHIBITION DEVICE) BEFORE YOU DO WORK ON OR
AROUND THE THRUST REVERSER. IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL AND SAFETY
THE INHIBITION DEVICE, THERE IS A RISK THAT THE THRUST REVERSER
CAN OPERATE ACCIDENTALLY. THIS CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSON
AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT.
ili. Open the Fan Exhaust Cowls in accordance with the AMM, Task 78-26-00
iv. Use appropriate staging to gain access to the Tail Bearing Housing TBH
2) Carry out the inspection on the Mount Lug Run-outs
WARNING: PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND SAFETY GLASSES MUST BE WORN AT ALL
TIMES DURING THE INSPECTION. IF YOU GET AN INJURY, SEEK MEDICAL
AID IMMEDIATELY.
|. This inspection must be performed in accordance with the requirements of AMM
70-20-02, Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection.
li. Local cleaning of the inspection areas must be completed prior to FPI.
ili. Apply OMat 150 — Acetone to a clean OMat 2/101 — Lint Free Cloth.
Iv. Clean the inspection surfaces (see Figures 1 and 2) with the moistened
cloth.
v. Ensure that all contaminants have been removed. If necessary repeat
steps (ili) and (iv) in order to achieve this.
NOTE: THE INSPECTION SURFACE, MUST BE CLEAN, DRY AND FREE FROM SOILS, OIL,
GREASE, PAINT, COATINGS, CORROSION PRODUCTS, SCALE, SMEARED
METAL, WELDING FLUX, CHEMICAL RESIDUES OR ANY OTHER MATERIAL
THAT COULD PREVENT PENETRANT FROM ENTERING A DISCONTINUITY,
AFFECT PROCESS PERFORMANCE OR PRODUCE AN UNACCEPTABLE
BACKGROUND.
vi. Allow 10 minutes for the area to completely dry prior to penetrant
application.

vii. Penetrant Application - Apply OMat 651F — 1D3 Penetrant to the inspection
areas (Figures 1 and 2) by brush or sponge applicator. The penetrant must be
dispensed from a sealed aerosol can and any unused penetrant must go to
waste.

vill. Ensure that the inspection area is fully covered with penetrant with the aid of a
UV lamp.

ix. Apply OMat 651F — 1D3 Penetrant to the OMat 677 — Penetrant Test Panel.

x. Leave the penetrant in contact with the components for 30 minutes.

NOTE: THE PENETRANT CONTACT TIME MUST NOT EXCEED 1 HOUR. IF IT DOES THE
PENETRANT MUST BE REAPPLIED AND 5 MINUTES CONTACT TIME
ALLOWED.

xi. Penetrant Removal - After the 30 minutes contact time, remove the excess
penetrant from the inspection surface and the OMat 677 — Penetrant Test Panel
by wiping thoroughly with a clean OMat 2/101 — Lint Free Cloth.

xii. Whilst illuminating with UV light, wipe off the penetrant with a clean
OMat 2/10 - Lint Free Cloth moistened with OMat 150 — Acetone. Use the
minimum application necessary to achieve acceptable background fluorescence
and ensure than acetone is not allowed to flow on the inspection surface.

xiii. Ensure that all traces of the OMat 150 — Acetone have been completely
removed.

xiv. Develop - Apply a light, even coating of OMat 617 — Non-Aqueous Wet
Developer from a sealed aerosol can to the inspection area and the OMat 677 —
Penetrant Test Panel.

xv. Allow 10 minutes contact time for the developer.

xvi. Cover the region of the engine with a dark non-reflective cover in order to reduce
the white light levels.

xvil. Ensure there are no white light sources or fluorescent items (including clothing)
within the inspection area or the inspector’s field of vision.

xviii. Do not wear darkened or light sensitive glasses.

xix. Allow 1 minute for eye adaptation to the darkened area.

xx. Illuminate the OMat 677 — Penetrant Test Panel with UV light at an intensity of no
less than 1200 W/cm? in the darkened area.

xxi. Inspect the OMat 677 — Penetrant Test Panel and check that the 4 largest
indications are visible and match the control photograph for that individual panel.

xxii. Illuminate the inspection surface with UV light at an intensity of no less than
1200 uW/cm’? in the darkened area.

xxili. Inspect the Mount Lug Run-Outs for crack indications.
