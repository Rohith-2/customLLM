B. Reason
Problem
Inspections of the Tail Bearing Housing (TBH) to Non-Modification Service
Bulletin (NMSB) 72-AG971 have identified crack indications in the mount Lug
forging Leading Edge (LE). This area is currently being inspected through NMSB
72-AH154.
A modification of the Tail Bearing Housing has been released in Service
Bulletin 72-J024. This modification introduces a local change of the Leading
edge profile, generating a cutback feature to reduce the stress on this
Location and minimise the risk of cracking. However, cracking may still occur
in the future. As a consequence, this Non-Modification Service Bulletin is
released to instruct the inspection of Tail Bearing Housings incorporating SB
(2-J024. This NMSB no Longer includes the requirement to inspect the fail safe
male catcher for damage. This was originally included in NMSB 72-AH154 to
support the root cause understanding of the leading edge cracking. This root
cause investigation has concluded that cracking is not related to a potential
contact of the catcher with the engine mounts.
C. Description
This NMSB instructs the following:
On-wing or in-shop Non-Destructive Test (NDT) inspections of the mount lug
forging LE and cutback areas which are required on Trent 900 engines
incorporating Service Bulletin /72-J024 fleet every 1000 flight cycles.
This NMSB details the on-wing and in-shop inspection techniques for the TBH.

ALERT
This NMSB is expected to be the subject of an EASA Airworthiness Directive.
Rolls-Royce recommends that the following action 1s undertaken to maintain
continued airworthiness.
This NMSB applies to both on-wing and in-shop activities.
(1) On-wing:
Accomplish the first inspection in accordance with section 3.A.
Accomplishment Instructions, accomplish the first inspection within 1000
flight cycles of the embodiment of SB 72-J024 for the TBH mount Lug
forging LE and cutback areas if it 1s not to be done in-shop.
Any TBH that received a full FPI in accordance with NMSB 72-AG971, 3.C.
Accomplishment Instructions are deemed as compliant with this NMSB
(72-AJ101).
Subsequent inspections whether in-shop or on-wing should be within 1000
cycles of previous inspection.
(2) In-shop:
Mount Lug Forging LE area (Local Inspection)
This inspection must be applied on all Engines where the Module 52 is
level 1 (Serviceability). The inspection must be carried out whilst the
part is at module Level and strip of the module to piece part is not
required.
For Engines where the Module 52 is Level 2 (Check and Repair) or above,
this Local inspection is not required if the TBH receives a full
Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection in accordance with NMSB 72-AG971, 3.C.
Accomplishment Instructions. Otherwise the Local inspection 1s required.
