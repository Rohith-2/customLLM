a.
B. Reason
Problem
R Re-analysis of Tail Bearing Housing (TBH) structural features identified a
R potential Limitation to the TBH capability in the fail safe condition. To
R confirm intact capability, an on-wing and in-shop inspection regime was defined
for the Trent 900 TBH. The structural features to be inspected are the TBH
mount Lug run-outs and Top Core Vanes (TCV). In addition, the Life of the TBH
R was Limited to 1/7200 cycles to make sure it did not enter in fail safe mode.
Additionally, historical inspections of the TBH to initial issue of
Non-Modification Service Bulletin (NMSB) 72-AG971 identified issues which
required additional inspection criteria as part of a revised containment
strategy. This has been addressed independently through NMSB 72-AH154.
R Revision 1 of this NMSB was issued to provide additional clarity for some of
the materials, tooling and cleaning tasks associated with inspections. It also
R revised the acceptance criteria for the on-wing inspections (section 3.A.(2))
R and introduced the inspection of the fail safe catcher in-shop to inform root
cause understanding for the issues addressed in NMSB 72-AH154.
R Revision 2 of this NMSB is issued to introduce eddy current inspection method
R as an alternative to the existing FP inspection of the mount Lug run out
R region. It also removes the Life Limitation for the component following a
R re-assessment of the TBH that has demonstrated full Limit load capability of
R the structure. The on-wing inspections of the mount Lug run-outs are to be
R maintained until a pin check is introduced into the Maintenance Planning
R Document (MPD) every 3800 flight cycles. Finally, it also clarifies that the
R Central Male Catcher Run-Out 1s also addressed as part of the full FP
R inspection of the TBH in the shop.
C. Description
This Non-Modification Service Bulletin (NMSB) instructs the following:

D. Compliance
ALERT
R This Non-Modification Service Bulletin is the subject of an EASA Airworthiness
R Directive AD 2013-0240.
Rolls-Royce recommends that the following action 1s undertaken to maintain
continued airworthiness.
This NMSB applies to both on-wing and in-shop activities.
(1) On-wing -— Localised Mount Lug Run-Outs Inspection:
Accomplish the first inspection in accordance with section 3.A. Accomplish
the first inspection within 2200 cycles for the TBH mount Lug run-outs if
it is not to be done in-shop. Subsequent inspections whether in-shop or
on-wing should be within 2200 cycles of previous inspection. Any TBH mount
Lug run-outs that were inspected to TV124801 or TV124851 prior to initial
issue of this NMSB are deemed as compliant with the NMSB.
(2) In-shop - Localised Mount Lug Run-outs Inspection:
Accomplish the first inspection in accordance with section 3.B. Accomplish
the first inspection within 2200 cycles for the TBH mount Lug run-outs if
it is not to be done on-wing or in-shop through full FPI of the TBH.
Subsequent inspections whether in-shop or on-wing should be within 2200
cycles of previous inspection. Any TBH mount Lug run-outs that were
inspected to TV124801 or TV124851 prior to initial issue of this NMSB are
deemed as compliant with the NMSB.
