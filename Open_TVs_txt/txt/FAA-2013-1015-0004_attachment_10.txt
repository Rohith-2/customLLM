E. On-Wing —Mount Lug Forging LE Area Inspection
WARNING: YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU WORK ON THE ENGINE AFTER THE
ENGINE IS SHUTDOWN. THE ENGINE CAN STAY HOT FOR UPTO ONE
HOUR.
WARNING: YOU MUST NOT TOUCH HOT PARTS WITHOUT APPLICABLE GLOVES. HOT
PARTS CAN CAUSE INJURY. IF YOU GET AN INJURY, TREAT WITH COLD
WATER FOR 10 MINUTES, THEN SEEK MEDICAL AID.
1) To get access to the mount lug forging LE Area
(i) Open the Fan Cowl Doors in accordance with AMM Task 71-13-00, Maintenance
Practices to get access
(ii) Make the Thrust Reverser unserviceable for maintenance in accordance with
AMM Task 78-30-00 Deactivation/Activation.
WARNING: YOU MUST MAKE THE THRUST REVERSER UNSERVICEABLE (INSTALL
AND SAFETY THE INHIBITION DEVICE) BEFORE YOU DO WORK ON OR
AROUND THE THRUST REVERSER. IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL AND SAFETY
THE INHIBITION DEVICE, THERE IS A RISK THAT THE THRUST REVERSER
CAN OPERATE ACCIDENTALLY. THIS CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSON
AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT.
(iii) Open the Fan Exhaust Cowls in accordance with the AMM, Task 78-26-00
(iv) Remove the Exhaust Nozzle to allow access to the rear of the TBH in
accordance with AMM, Task 78-11-41-000-801-A
(v) Remove the Aft Exhaust Plug in accordance with AMM, Task 78-11-42-000-804-
A
(vi) Remove the Forward Exhaust Plug in accordance with AMM, Task 78-11-42-
000-803-A
NOTE: STEPS (iv) TO (vi) ARE OPTIONAL TASKS INTENDED TO IMPROVE ACCESS
TO THE TBH. IF SUITABLE ACCESS CAN BE GAINED WITHOUT
PERFORMING SOME OR ALL OF TASKS (iv) TO (vi) THEN THEY ARE NOT
REQUIRED.
(vii) Use appropriate staging and platforms to gain access to the Tail Bearing Housing
2) Processing the penetrant test panel
(i) The OMat 677 — penetrant test panel must be processed at the beginning of
each shift and viewed in each engine that is to be inspected during the shift in
order to ensure that the test environment and materials are acceptable.

(ii) Ensure the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel is clean and there is no residual
fluorescence.

(iii) Cover the region of the engine to be inspected with a dark non-reflective cover in
order to reduce the white light levels in the leading edge inspection area.

(iv) Apply OMat 632 penetrant to the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel by sponge
applicator or brush. The penetrant must be dispensed from a sealed aerosol can
and any unused penetrant must go to waste following the inspection.

(v) Leave the penetrant in contact with the panel for 20 minutes.

(vi) After the 20 minutes contact time, take the OMat 677 penetrant test panel inside
the darkened area to process. Allow 3 minutes for eye adaptation to the low light
levels.

(vii) Remove the excess penetrant from the panel surface by wiping thoroughly with a
clean, dry OMat 2/101 — lint free cloth whilst illuminating the panel with UV light.

(vill) © Soak a clean OMat 2/10 - lint free cloth in water and then gently squeeze the
excess water out to reduce the flow of water on the panel surface.

(ix) Whilst illuminating the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel with UV light, wipe off the
penetrant with the wet cloth before immediately wiping over with a clean, dry
OMatz2/10 lint free cloth. Repeat this process using the minimum application
necessary to achieve acceptable background fluorescence.

(x) Ensure that the panel is dry by wiping with a clean, dry OMat2/10 lint free cloth.

(xi) Apply a light, even coating of OMat 617 — non-aqueous wet developer from a
sealed aerosol can to the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel.

(xii) Allow 10 minutes contact time for the developer prior to inspecting the panel.

(xiil) Ensure there are no white light sources or fluorescent items (including clothing)
within the darkened area.

(xiv) | Hold the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel alongside the leading edge of the Top
Core Vanes and illuminate it with UV light.

(xv) Inspect the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel and check that the visible
indications match the control photograph for that panel.

(xvi) If the panel matches the photograph then the inspection materials and
environment are acceptable and the inspections can be performed.

(xvii) Repeat steps (xiii) to (xvi) for each engine to be inspected during the shift.
Ensure that the inspection area is darkened for each engine.

(xvili) Restore the OMat 677 — penetrant test panel to a completely clean condition and
ensure there is no residual fluorescence and store in acetone.

3) Carry out the inspection of the Mount Lug Forging LE Area
WARNING: PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND SAFETY GLASSES MUST BE WORN AT ALL
TIMES DURING THE INSPECTION. IF YOU GET AN INJURY, SEEK MEDICAL
AID IMMEDIATELY.
