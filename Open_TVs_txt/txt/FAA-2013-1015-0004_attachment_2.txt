F A SA Airworthiness Directive
> A AD No.: 2016-0193
~~“ * European Aviation Safety Agency
Issued: 30 September 2016
Note: This Airworthiness Directive (AD) is issued by EASA, acting in accordance with Regulation
(EC) 216/2008 on behalf of the European Union, its Member States and of the European third
countries that participate in the activities of EASA under Article 66 of that Regulation.
This AD is issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) 748/2012, Part 21.A.3B. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 1321/2014 Annex |, Part M.A.301, the
continuing airworthiness of an aircraft shall be ensured by accomplishing any applicable ADs. Consequently, no person may operate an aircraft to which
an AD applies, except in accordance with the requirements of that AD, unless otherwise specified by the Agency [Regulation (EU) 1321/2014 Annex I,
Part M.A.303] or agreed with the Authority of the State of Registry [Regulation (EC) 216/2008, Article 14(4) exemption].
Design Approval Holder’s Name: Type/Model designation(s):
ROLLS-ROYCE plc RB211 Trent 900 Engines
Effective Date: 14 October 2016
TCDS Number(s): EASA.E.012
Foreign AD: Not applicable
Supersedure: This AD supersedes EASA AD 2013-0240 issued 30 September 2013, including its
Correction dated 04 October 2013.
ATA 72 — Engine — Low Pressure Turbine Exhaust Case and Support Assembly (Tail
Bearing Housing) — Inspection / Replacement
Manufacturer(s):
Rolls-Royce plc (RR)
Applicability:
RB211 Trent 970-84, 970B-84, 972-84, 972B-84, 977-84, 977B-84 and 980-84 engines, all serial
numbers. These engines are known to be installed on, but not limited to, Airbus A380 aeroplanes.
Reason:
RR performed a re-analysis of the structural features of the Trent 900 low pressure turbine exhaust
case and support assembly (also known as Tail Bearing Housing, or TBH). The result of this re-
analysis indicated that the TBH may not retain full limit load capability in all fail-safe conditions. In
addition, during previous inspections of Trent 900 TBH mounts and vanes, cracks were found in the
outer annulus leading edge (LE) fillet of some vanes.
These conditions, if not detected and corrected, could lead to disconnection of the TBH structural
ring from the mounts, possibly resulting in damage to, or reduced control of, the aeroplane.
To address this potential unsafe condition, RR published Alert Non-Modification Service Bulletin
(NMSB) RB.211-72-AG971 and NMSB RB.211-72-AH154, providing inspection instructions and
criteria for replacement of parts.

Consequently, EASA issued AD 2013-0240, to require on-wing and in-shop inspections of the TBH
structural features to detect cracks or damage and, depending on findings, the accomplishment of
applicable corrective action(s).

Since that AD was issued, further inspection results were analysed, and concluded that on-wing

inspections of the Fail Safe Catcher are no longer necessary, but that in-shop inspections of the

Central Male Catcher Run-out should be required. In addition, a modification (mod) of the TBH was

developed by RR, available for in-service engines through Service Bulletin (SB) RB.211-72-J024,

introducing a cutback of the leading edge profile through rework of existing parts, which reduces
the stress and minimises the risk of cracking. An inspection regime for post-mod 72-JO024 engines
was therefore developed and RR published Alert NMSB RB.211-72-AJ101 accordingly. In addition,

further analysis has shown that a TBH life limit is no longer necessary. In addition, RR developed a

modification (mod 72-J055), made available for in-service engines through SB RB.211-72-J055,

which introduces a TBH with increased strength capability, deleting the need for inspections.

For the reasons described above, this AD partially retains the requirements of EASA AD 2013-0240,

which is superseded, deleting the TBH life limits previously imposed by that AD, changing certain

inspection requirements, introducing repetitive inspections for post-SB 72-JO24 engines, and
specifying the (optional) terminating action.

Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s):

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously:

Note 1: Where, in this AD, reference is made to a RR mod, SB or NMSB with an ‘A’ (Alert) in the

number, it should be recognised that an earlier or later revision may not have that ‘A’. This kind of

change does not effectively alter the publication references for the purpose of this AD.

Note 2: The TBH affected by this AD are identified by Part Number (P/N):

- pre-mod 72-J024: P/N FW27718, P/N FW35923 and P/N FW51434

On-wing Inspections:

(1) Within the compliance times specified in Appendix 1 of this AD, as applicable to the TBH P/N,
accomplish on-wing inspections of the TBH features in accordance with the instructions of the
specified sections of the applicable RR Alert NMSB, as referenced in Appendix 1 of this AD.

In-shop Inspections:

(2) Within the compliance times specified in Appendix 2 of this AD, as applicable to the TBH P/N,
accomplish in-shop inspections of the TBH features in accordance with the instructions of the
specified sections of the applicable RR Alert NMSB, as referenced in Appendix 2 of this AD.

Corrective Action(s):

Credit:

(10) Inspections and corrective actions, accomplished on an engine before the effective date of
this AD, in accordance with the instructions of applicable sections of earlier issues of RR Alert
NMSB RB.211-72-AG971, or earlier issues of RR Alert NMSB RB.211-72-AH154, as applicable,
are acceptable to comply with the initial requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this AD, as

inspections required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this AD for that engine.

(12) Modification of an engine in accordance with the instructions of RR SB RB.211-72-J055
constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspections required by paragraph (1) and (2)
of this AD for that engine, provided that, following modification, no affected TBH (see Note 2
of this AD) is installed on that engine.

(13) No actions are required by this AD for an engine that embodies RR mod 72-J055 in production,
