B. Concurrent Requirements
None.
C. Reason
(1) Problem
The LP turbine exhaust case and support assembly can suffer premature
cracking at the radius of the leading edge of vanes 1 and 14. The problem
is attributed to Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) as a result of the
thermo-mechanical loads experienced during the flight cycle. Engineering
analysis has established that there are differences between the actual
Loads compared to the predicted Loads used during the original
determination of fatigue Life.
The Non Destructive Test (NDT) inspection process used at the manufacturer
may not detect all cracks in the welds of the turbine exhaust case and
support assembly. Cracks may subsequently be found during metallurgical
analysis of the component.
The outer skin stiffeners, Located on the top of the turbine exhaust case
and support assembly, may be susceptible to cracking in the fillet weld.
The problem is attributed to insufficient contact between the end corners
of the stiffeners and the base material of the case assembly, during the
welding process. Consequently, a lack of full weld penetration may occur.

ES OC BULLETIN
Design best practice is to minimise the risk of contaminating critical
parts with silver residue. Engineering evaluation has determined that
there 1s a possibility of cross-contamination of silver onto the LP
turbine disc assembly, which is Located forward of the baffle plate. The
disc is a critical part. The problem is attributed to self-locking plate
nuts, which contain silver plating, Located on the front of the baffle =
plate on the front inner support cone of the exhaust case and support 5
assembly. Cross-contamination may occur during assembly and overhaul 2
activities. >

(2) Evidence o
wo
The problem of cracking has been identified during in-service Fluorescent >
Penetrant Inspections (FPI) and subsequent Laboratory examination of
sample components.
(3) Substantiation
The changes introduced by this modification have been the subject of
satisfactory engineering evaluation, including stress and thermal
analysis, using revised modelling methods. Analysis of the revised design
has shown that the outer skin stiffeners are not required to demonstrate
the buckling capability of the LP turbine exhaust case and support
assembly.
The results of the thermal modelling assessment verifies in-service and
development engine testing data.
The results of new thermal analysis, conducted by specialists at the
manufacturer, support the results of the stress analysis.
Furthermore, the accuracy of the revised modelling techniques has been
cross-validated. Examination of in-service components, found to be cracked
following the FPI, has taken place. Comparison with the predicted cracking
from the revised modelling methods confirms the modelling reflects actual
cracking experienced during in-service operations.
(4) Objective
Incorporation of this Service Bulletin (Modification) is designed to
maintain reliability.
(5) Effect of Bulletin on:
(a) Operation
Not affected.
(b) Maintenance
Not affected.
